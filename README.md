# iptoc
This project is a simple tool to convert IP address to country code. It uses Maxmind GeoIP databases.  This tool was created to demonstrate leveraging Apple Shortcuts to execute a Python script with arguments retrieved from the GUI.  In addition, the Apple Shortcuts below take the output of the Script and launch an Apple application using the output from the Python script as input arguments to the application launched (Apple Maps in this case).  Screenshots of the Apple Shortcuts are below.
